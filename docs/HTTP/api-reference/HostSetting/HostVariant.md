# HostVariant

The HostVariant class is a critical component in managing HTTP connections and handling HTTP requests for a specific host. It maintains a queue of requests and a list of active connections associated with the host, ensuring efficient utilization of available resources. Additionally, it supports protocol version detection (HTTP/1 or HTTP/2) for optimized communication with the host.

- It maintains a queue of requests to ensure efficient and controlled use of available connections.
- It supports HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 protocol versions, allowing requests to be sent using the appropriate protocol based on the host's protocol support.
- Provides methods for sending requests, recycling connections, managing connection state, and handling the shutdown of connections and the host variant itself.
- It includes logging for diagnostic purposes, helping to monitor and debug the behavior of connections and requests.



In summary, the HostVariant class plays a central role in managing HTTP connections and requests for a specific host, ensuring efficient and reliable communication with that host while supporting different protocol versions.
