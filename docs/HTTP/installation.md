# Installation Guide

Getting started with Best HTTP is straightforward. 
Depending on your preference, you can either install the package via the Unity Asset Store or use a .unitypackage. 
Below are step-by-step guides for both methods:

## Installing from the Unity Asset Store using the Package Manager Window

1. **Purchase:** If you haven't previously purchased the package, proceed to do so. Once purchased, Unity will recognize your purchase, and you can install the package directly from within the Unity Editor. If you already own the package, you can skip these steps.
    1. **Visit the Unity Asset Store:** Using your preferred web browser, navigate to the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/4137?aid=1101lfX8E).
    2. **Search for Best HTTP:** Utilize the search bar on the Unity Asset Store to look for "Best HTTP". Identify the official Best HTTP package in the search results.
2. **Open Unity & Access the Package Manager:** Launch Unity and open your desired project. Navigate to [Window > Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html).
3. **Select 'My Assets':** In the Package Manager window, switch to the [My Assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-import.html) tab. This will show all assets you have access to, including ones you've purchased or added to your Asset Store account.
4. **Find Best HTTP and Download:** Locate "Best HTTP" in the list. Once found, click on it to view the details. If the package isn't already downloaded, you'll see a Download button. Click this button and wait for the package to download. Once downloaded, the button will change to Import.
5. **Import the Package:** After downloading, click the Import button. Unity will then show you a list of all the assets associated with the Best HTTP package. Ensure all assets are checked and click Import.
6. **Confirmation:** Upon importing, Best HTTP will be added to your project, indicating a successful installation.

## Installing from a .unitypackage file

In some cases you might have a .unitypackage file containing the plugin. 

1. **Download the .unitypackage:** Ensure you have the Best HTTP.unitypackage file saved on your computer. This might be from a direct download link or an email attachment, depending on how it was distributed.
2. **Import into Unity:** Launch Unity and open your project. Go to Assets > Import Package > Custom Package.
3. **Locate and Select the .unitypackage:** Navigate to the location where you saved the Best HTTP.unitypackage file. Select it and click Open.
4. **Review and Import:** Unity will show you a list of all the assets contained in the package. Make sure all assets are selected and click Import.
5. **Confirmation:** After importing, you should see all the Best HTTP assets added to your project's Asset folder, confirming a successful installation.

!!! Note
    Best HTTP also supports other installation methods as documented in Unity's manual for packages. 
    For more advanced installation options, refer to the Unity Manual on [Sharing Packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-share.html).
