# UnitTask Integration

When the [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) package is installed, the plugin will automatically use it for its [Task based APIs](../getting-started/index.md#async-await).

To install UnitTask, follow its [UPM Package install guide](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask#upm-package).

!!! Note "When UniTask is added, all assembly definitions referencing `com.Tivadar.Best.HTTP` must be referencing `UniTask` too!"
