# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: **Whitch platforms are supported?**

**A:** All major platforms are officially supported, specifically:

- **Desktop**: Windows, Linux, MacOS
- **Mobile**: iOS, Android
- **Universal Windows Platform** (UWP)
- **Web**: WebGL
- Furthermore, user reports suggest that Best HTTP also functions on the following platforms. However, due to the lack of testing capabilities, official support for these platforms is not provided:
	- :fontawesome-brands-xbox: Xbox
	- :fontawesome-brands-playstation: PlayStation
	- :simple-nintendoswitch: Nintendo Switch
	
	Please note that while there is evidence of compatibility with these platforms, I'm unable to offer official support or guarantee full functionality due to testing limitations.
