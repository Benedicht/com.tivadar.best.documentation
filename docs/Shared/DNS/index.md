# What is DNS?
Domain Name System (DNS) is a foundational technology responsible for resolving human-readable hostnames into IP addresses, allowing systems to communicate with one another over the internet. 
For instance, when you enter a URL (like "www.google.com") into a web browser, DNS translates it to an IP address to locate and connect to the website's server.

## Why is DNS Important?
DNS is critical for various reasons:

1. **Human-friendly Communication:** Without DNS, users would need to memorize and enter IP addresses (like 123.456.78.9) instead of easily remembered names (like "www.example.com").
2. **Connection Speed:** DNS resolution plays a pivotal role in determining how quickly users can connect to a desired server.
3. **Internet Infrastructure:** DNS provides a global directory service, ensuring the seamless functioning of the internet.
