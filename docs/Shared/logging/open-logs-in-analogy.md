## Best HTTP Log Parser Provider for Analogy.LogViewer

The [Analogy.LogViewer.BestHTTPLogParser](https://github.com/Benedicht/Analogy.LogViewer.BestHTTPLogParser) is a log parser provider designed for use with [Analogy.LogViewer](https://github.com/Analogy-LogViewer/Analogy.LogViewer). 
With its help large amount of log entries can be processed, filtered and overview to locate specific HTTP requests or problematic areas.

## Analyzing Logs with Analogy.LogViewer

Analogy.LogViewer is a powerful tool for reading and processing log files, including those generated by the Best HTTP library. 
Its user-friendly interface and robust feature set make it an ideal choice for detailed log analysis.

!!! Note "All of the Best assets are using the same infrastructure, this same tool can be used to filter for entries generated by the Best Socket.IO for example!"

- The logs will be displayed in an organized and readable format.

## Using and Analyzing Logs

The `Method Name` and `Data Source/File Name` columns aren't used, you can right click and on them to choose `Hide This Column` to hide them. This can be used on other non interested columns.
Later they can be re-added by righ clicking on a cloumn and using the `Column Chooser` menu item.

Each protocol or class that has long-running logic has its own unique hash saved with every log entry generated, these will show up as additional columns:

Whit the help of these hashes, if one log entry can be located corresponding to the problematic area (like a status code of 500 of a failed HTTPRequest), 
it's possible to use that entry's one or more hashes to filter for only those entries that belongs to that failed request. Using filtering it's easy to remove uninteresting entries and focus on one area:

## Advanced Features

### Calculate Time Difference

It's a common need to know how much time passed between two entries. Every entry carries the maximum supported time precision when its line executed and displayed in the `Date` column.
In itself the `Date` column doesn't have too much value, but Analogy has a way to calculate time difference from a reference entry. You can click on an entry (preferably on the first log entry) and choose the `Calculate time difference from this point` menu item:

When Analogy finishes with the calculation, the `Time Difference` column will be filled with new entries:
