# Profilers

The Best HTTP package is equipped with robust profiling tools right out of the box: a memory profiler and a network profiler. 
Both are activated by default, ensuring that you have immediate insight into your application's performance and network interactions. 
In the upcoming sections, we'll delve deeper into the features and benefits of each profiler.

# Dependency

In order to be able to work the profilers require the [com.unity.profiling.core](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.profiling.core@1.0/manual/index.html) present. 
Best HTTP's package.json contains it as a dependency, if not already installed in the project, it should be added by the Package Manager automatically.
