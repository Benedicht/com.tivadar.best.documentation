## WebSocket

First of all, in a file where you want to use the WebSocket class, you have to add the right namespace using:
```cs
using Best.WebSockets;
```

To create a new `WebSocket` instance is as easy as calling its constructor:
!!! Example "`#!cs var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));`"

## Events

### OnOpen

Called when connection to the server is established.
After this event the WebSocketâ€™s IsOpen property will be True until we or the server closes the connection or if an error occurs.

!!! Example
    ```cs hl_lines="2 6"
    var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));
    webSocket.OnOpen += OnWebSocketOpen;

    webSocket.Open();

    private void OnWebSocketOpen(WebSocket webSocket)
    {
	    Debug.Log("WebSocket is now Open!");
    }
    ```

### OnMessage

Called when a textual message received from the server.

!!! Example
    ```cs hl_lines="2 6"
    var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));
    webSocket.OnMessage += OnMessageReceived;

    webSocket.Open();

    private void OnMessageReceived(WebSocket webSocket, string message)
    {
	    Debug.Log("Text Message received from server: " + message);
    }
    ```

### OnBinary

Called when a binary blob message received from the server, it receives a [BufferSegment](../../HTTP/api-reference/Memory/BufferSegment.md).
The received bytes can be accessed through the buffer's `Data` field. In most cases `Data` is a larger array then the received message so it's important to use the buffer's `Count` field instead of `Data.Length`!

!!! Example
    ```cs hl_lines="2 6 16"
    var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));
    webSocket.OnBinary += OnBinaryMessageReceived;

    webSocket.Open();

    private void OnBinaryMessageReceived(WebSocket webSocket, BufferSegment buffer)
    {
	    Debug.Log("Binary Message received from server. Length: " + buffer.Length);

        using (var stream = System.IO.File.OpenWrite("path\to\file"))
        {
            // ðŸ“› This is BAD, don't use it like this!!
            //stream.Write(buffer.Data, 0, buffer.Data.Length);

            // âœ… Good:
            stream.Write(buffer.Data, buffer.Offset, buffer.Count);
        }
    }
    ```

!!! warning "The content of the buffer must be used or copied to a new array in the callbacks because the plugin reuses the memory immediately after the callback by placing it back to the [BufferPool](../../HTTP/api-reference/Memory/BufferPool.md)!"

### OnClosed

Called when the client or the server closes the connection.
When the client closes the connection through the Close function it can provide a Code and a Message that indicates the reason for closing. 
The server typically will echoes our Code and Message back.

!!! Example
    ```cs hl_lines="2 6 10"
    var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));
    webSocket.OnClosed += OnWebSocketClosed;

    webSocket.Open();

    private void OnWebSocketClosed(WebSocket webSocket, WebSocketStatusCodes code, string message)
    {
	    Debug.Log("WebSocket is now Closed!");

        if (code == WebSocketStatusCodes.NormalClosure)
        {
            // Closed by request
        }
        else
        {
            // Error
        }
    }
    ```

### OnInternalRequestCreated

Called when the internal `HTTPRequest` object created. The plugin might call it more than once for one WebSocket instance if it has to fall back from the HTTP/2 implementation to the HTTP/1 one. It's not available under WebGL.

## Methods

All methods are non-blocking, `Open` and `Close` just starts the opening and closing logic, `Send` places the data to a buffer that will be picked up by the sender thread.

### Open

Calling `Open()` we can start the connection procedure to the server.

```cs
var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));
webSocket.Open();
```
!!! note "Just as other calls, Open is **not** a blocking call. Messages can be sent to the server after an **OnOpen** event."

### Send

Send has a few overrides, but the most common is to send text or binary.

Sending out text messages:
```cs hl_lines="10"
var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));
webSocket.OnOpen += OnWebSocketOpen;

webSocket.Open();

private void OnWebSocketOpen(WebSocket webSocket)
{
	Debug.Log("WebSocket is now Open!");

    webSocket.Send("Message to the Server");
}
```

Sending out binary messages:
```cs hl_lines="13"
var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));
webSocket.OnOpen += OnWebSocketOpen;

webSocket.Open();

private void OnWebSocketOpen(WebSocket webSocket)
{
	Debug.Log("WebSocket is now Open!");

    // Allocate and fill up the buffer with data
    byte[] buffer = new byte[length];

    webSocket.Send(buffer);
}
```

Large messages (larger than 32767 bytes by default) are sent fragmented to the server.

Websocket frames produced by the `Send` methods are placed into an internal queue and a sender thread going to send them one by one. The `BufferedAmount` property keeps track the amount of bytes sitting in this queue. 

### `SendAsText(BufferSegment data)`

Will send data as a text frame and takes owenership over the memory region releasing it to the [BufferPool](../../HTTP/api-reference/Memory/BufferPool.md) as soon as possible.

### `SendAsBinary(BufferSegment data)`

Will send the data in one or more binary frame and takes ownership over it calling [BufferPool](../../HTTP/api-reference/Memory/BufferPool.md). Release when sent.

### Close

After all communication is done we should close the connection by calling the `Close()` method.

```cs hl_lines="10"
var webSocket = new WebSocket(new Uri("wss://websocketserver/ws"));
webSocket.OnOpen += OnWebSocketOpen;

webSocket.Open();

private void OnWebSocketOpen(WebSocket webSocket)
{
	Debug.Log("WebSocket is now Open!");

    webSocket.Close();
}
```

!!! note "You canâ€™t reuse a closed WebSocket instance, you have to create and setup a new one."

## Properties

### IsOpen

It's `true` if the websocket connection is open for sending and receiving.

### State

It's more verbose about the sate of the WebSocket than the `IsOpen` property. State can be `Connecting`, `Open`, `Closing`, `Closed` and `Unknown`.

### BufferedAmount

The amount of unsent, buffered up data in bytes.
