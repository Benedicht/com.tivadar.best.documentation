Welcome to the Best WebSockets Documentation! Best WebSockets is a premier networking library for Unity, tailored specifically for seamless WebSocket integration. 
It's perfect for applications that require real-time, bi-directional communication such as chat applications, multiplayer games, and live interactive systems.

!!! Warning
	Please be aware that Best WebSockets is a **client-side implementation only**. If you're looking to set up a WebSocket server, you'll need to explore server-side implementations and libraries specific to your programming language and platform.

	Ensure you're deploying the correct component for your needs!

## Overview
In the fast-paced digital landscape, real-time communication is crucial for a multitude of applications. 
Whether it's sending instantaneous game state updates, chat messages, or receiving live feeds, WebSockets provide an edge in facilitating these real-time interactions. 
Best WebSockets is crafted to effortlessly integrate this technology into your Unity projects, making bi-directional communication straightforward and efficient.

## :fontawesome-solid-fire-flame-curved:{.red} Essential Dependency :fontawesome-solid-fire-flame-curved:{.red}
Best WebSockets is built upon and necessarily requires the [Best HTTP package](../HTTP/index.md). 
This foundational package not only provides the core mechanisms for the asset but also bestows its renowned reliability and top-tier performance. 
Before diving into Best WebSockets, ensure the Best HTTP dependency is correctly integrated into your Unity project, guaranteeing a seamless and high-performance networking journey.
